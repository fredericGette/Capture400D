# Capture400D
Very simple android app to retrieve "on the fly" captured pictures from a Canon EOS 400D.

Thanks to this app I can continue to use my old Canon even if its CF slot is broken.

- Connect your Canon EOS 400D to your android device.
- Turn on the Camera.
- Wait initialization (the app "beeps" at the end of the initialization process).
- Take a picture.
- The picture is downloaded from the camera to the android device (in the folder "pictures")
- Take another picture...
